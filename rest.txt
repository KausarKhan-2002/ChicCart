Introduction of js _________________________
1.Javascript is a dynamic type synchronous programming single threaded and prototype based language.

Dynamic type -----------
2.Dynamic type means as a developer we don't need to specify datatype because on the basis of our 
  provided value js will self consider it's datatype.

Synchronous programming ------------------
3.Synchronous programming means as we know js executes line by line if the execution of current line 
  is finished then it will move to the next line that is how js works in synchronous way.
4.But due to synchronous programming sometimes some important instructions get block which cause 
  delay in UI that means If suppose If I am fetching the data from API obviously It will take time to 
  fetch the data and next line will get block due to current line that is why We need to execute that code 
  in asynchronous way which are coming from API so that rest of the codes can't wait to finish it's 
  execution and to to consider asynchronous programming Browser provides web Api's to the js that we 
  can access from window object like setTimeout, setInterval, Promises, Async Await etc.

Single thread ----------------------
5.Js is single threaded that means It can only do one thing at a time so in the sense it 
  executes code on a single main thread.This is due to it's event loop model, which ensures 
  asynchronous operations are handled without blocking the main thread where all the code runs one 
  line after another.
  No simultaneous execution, Js does not execute multiple tasks on seprate threads simultaneously on 
  a same enviroment, simple.

Prototype --------------------------
